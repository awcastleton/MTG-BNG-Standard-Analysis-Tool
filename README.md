# A few notes

There is always going to be more that can be accomplished with this, however as it stands this tool is comprehensive and actually tells the story of the format on a whole.  I would like there to be a larger dataset, there are certainly more decklists to pull off of other websites, but there are also redundencies between websites that would be difficult to track down and I am not convinced that the story told by the data would be any different.

Card pricing and colors are other things that could be implemented if I had more time, but the most important information is relayed in a neat and organized manner.

All in all, I am happy with the way this product turned out and it was an incredibly valuable learning experience.
